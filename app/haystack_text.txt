The Grand Tapestry of Digital Evolution: From Vacuum Tubes to the Cloud  

**Section 1: The Mechanical Age and the Birth of Computation**  

The concept of automated calculation predates modern electronics by centuries, tracing its roots back to ancient civilizations where abacuses and slide rules served as rudimentary tools for arithmetic. In the 17th century, French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal invented the Pascaline, a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction through a series of gears and wheels, primarily designed to assist his father, a tax collector, in tedious computations. This device represented an early triumph over manual drudgery, though limited by its inability to handle multiplication or division directly. Building on this, German polymath Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed the Stepped Reckoner in 1673, which ambitiously aimed to perform all four basic arithmetic operations, introducing the concept of a stepped drum—a cylindrical gear with teeth of varying lengths that facilitated shifting carries in calculations.  

However, the true intellectual progenitor of the modern computer emerged in the 19th century with Charles Babbage, an English mathematician and inventor. In the 1820s, frustrated by the prevalence of errors in printed mathematical tables used for navigation and engineering, Babbage designed the Difference Engine. This massive machine, intended to automatically compute polynomial functions via the method of finite differences, promised to eliminate human error at scale. Though only a portion was built during his lifetime—demonstrating feasibility through intricate brass mechanisms—its ambition foreshadowed programmable machinery. Babbage's later vision, the Analytical Engine conceived in the 1830s, elevated this to unprecedented heights.  

The Analytical Engine incorporated all essential components of a contemporary general-purpose computer: a "mill" analogous to the central processing unit (CPU) for executing operations, a "store" functioning as memory to hold variables and intermediate results, and sophisticated input/output mechanisms using punched cards for both data and instructions. Unlike prior calculators, it supported conditional branching and looping, enabling complex algorithms. This theoretical marvel, detailed in exhaustive blueprints spanning thousands of pages, never materialized due to funding shortfalls and mechanical limitations, yet its blueprint ignited the spark of digital computation. Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron and a brilliant mathematician in her own right, collaborated with Babbage and published extensive notes in 1843 translating an Italian engineer's article. She appended her own insights, including a detailed algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers—widely regarded as the world's first computer program. Lovelace foresaw the machine's potential beyond numerical crunching, prophetically noting it could manipulate symbols like music or graphics, establishing the foundational principle of universal programmability.  

Decades later, the exigencies of the U.S. Census catalyzed practical electromechanical innovation. In 1880, processing over 60 million cards took nearly a decade; statistician Herman Hollerith addressed this inefficiency with his tabulating machine, employing punched cards inspired by railroad ticket systems. Each card encoded demographic data via holes punched in specific columns, read electrically by spring-loaded pins completing circuits. This slashed census time to months, proving data processing's scalability. Hollerith's Tabulating Machine Company, leveraging patents and government contracts, evolved into the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company in 1911, rebranded as International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924—a lineage underscoring electromechanical precursors' enduring legacy. These devices, bridging mechanical ingenuity and electrical detection, paved the way for the electronic era, transforming computation from artisanal craft to industrial powerhouse.  

**Section 2: Electronic Dawn and the First Generation of Computers**  

World War II accelerated the shift from mechanical relays to vacuum tubes, heralding high-speed electronic computation amid existential imperatives. In Britain, the Colossus—conceived by engineer Tommy Flowers—cracked Nazi Enigma and Lorenz ciphers at Bletchley Park. Deployed in 1943, it featured 1,500 vacuum tubes and 2,400 valves for parallel processing, analyzing teleprinter streams at 5,000 characters per second. Its programmable nature via switches and plugs marked a leap in real-time cryptanalysis, shortening the war by years, though details remained classified until the 1970s. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. Moore School of Electrical Engineering birthed ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) in 1945, commissioned for Army ballistics. Weighing 30 tons, occupying 1,800 square feet, and housing 17,468 vacuum tubes, it performed 5,000 additions per second—1,000 times faster than mechanical calculators—consuming 150 kilowatts akin to a small factory. Programmed via patch cords and switches, reconfiguration took days, limiting flexibility despite ballistic, atomic, and weather simulations.  

A pivotal paradigm shift crystallized in John von Neumann's 1945 EDVAC report, articulating the stored-program architecture. Hitherto, instructions resided on separate media like punched tapes; von Neumann proposed unifying code and data in modifiable memory, enabling self-modifying programs and rapid task-switching without rewiring. This von Neumann architecture—featuring a single bus shuttling instructions and data—underpins virtually all classical computers. Early exemplars included EDVAC (1949) and Britain's EDSAC (1949), the latter running its first program calculating square roots via subroutines. Manchester University's "Baby" (1948), the world's first stored-program computer, validated the concept publicly.  

Commercial viability dawned with UNIVAC I (1951), delivered to the U.S. Census Bureau. Boasting 5,200 tubes and mercury delay-line memory storing 1,000 words, it predicted Dwight Eisenhower's landslide victory on CBS in 1952—televising computing's prescience to millions. Over 40 UNIVACs served government, insurance, and airlines, processing payrolls and reservations. This vacuum-tube epoch, augmented by magnetic drums (rotating cylinders coated in iron oxide for non-volatile storage) and rudimentary peripherals like line printers, defined first-generation computing (1946–1958). Machine-language programming—binary opcodes directly wired to hardware—demanded heroic assembly, yet birthed institutions like RAND Corporation's data centers, cementing electronics as computation's vanguard. Reliability challenges persisted: tubes burned out frequently, mandating "tube nurseries" for hot-swapping, but exponential speed gains propelled humanity toward digital ubiquity.  


**Section 3: Transistors, Integrated Circuits, and the Minicomputer Era**  

The second generation of computers (1957–1964) shattered the fragility of vacuum tubes with the transistor, a semiconductor marvel invented in 1947 at Bell Laboratories by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley. This point-contact transistor, leveraging germanium crystals doped with impurities to control electron flow via electric fields, was orders of magnitude smaller (fingertip-sized), consumed a fraction of power (milliwatts versus kilowatts), generated negligible heat, and boasted lifespans measured in decades rather than hours. IBM's 7090 (1959), a transistorized behemoth with 60,000 transistors, processed scientific simulations at 229,000 instructions per second, serving NASA and the Air Force for trajectory computations during the Space Race.  

High-level languages democratized programming: FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), released by IBM in 1957 under John Backus, enabled engineers to code in mathematical notation, compiling to efficient machine code via innovative optimization algorithms that eliminated common subexpressions and loop unrolling. COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language), spearheaded by Grace Hopper in 1959, standardized data processing with English-like syntax—READ PAYROLL-FILE, ADD GROSS-PAY TO TOTAL-WAGES—facilitating portability across vendors. Magnetic core memory, tiny ferrite donuts wired in 2D grids and accessed via coincident current selection, provided reliable random-access storage at 10 microseconds latency, supplanting unreliable drums.  

The third generation (1964–1971) arrived with the integrated circuit (IC), a paradigm where multiple transistors formed monolithic silicon structures. Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments etched the first IC in 1958 using germanium, while Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor perfected the planar silicon process in 1959, enabling mass production via photolithography—projecting circuit patterns through masks onto photoresist-coated wafers, etched with hydrofluoric acid. IBM's System/360 (1964), the first IC-based mainframe family, offered upward compatibility across models, from the budget S/360-20 to the behemoth S/360-195, revolutionizing enterprise computing with virtual memory via paging (dividing address space into fixed-size pages swapped to disk) and multiprogramming (interleaving tasks via time-slicing).  

Minicomputers proliferated, shrinking mainframes to refrigerator size. Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC) PDP-8 (1965), priced at $18,000 versus $3 million mainframes, packed 12-bit words, 4K words of core memory expandable to 32K, and an instruction set supporting indexed addressing for efficient data structures. Universities deployed PDP-8s for bioinformatics and physics simulations; hospitals used them for patient monitoring. The PDP-11 (1970) introduced 16-bit architecture and Unix—Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie's elegant OS at Bell Labs, written in C (1972), a portable systems language with pointers enabling dynamic memory allocation. These innovations catalyzed time-sharing, where multiple users interactively accessed a single machine via teletypes, foreshadowing modern multi-tenancy.[1]

**Section 4: The Microprocessor Revolution and Personal Computing**  

The fourth generation ignited with the microprocessor, condensing an entire CPU onto one chip. Intel's 4004 (1971), a 4-bit processor clocked at 740 kHz with 2,300 transistors on 10-micron process, targeted Busicom calculators but birthed general-purpose computing-in-a-chip. Federico Faggin, Ted Hoff, and Stanley Mazor architected its register set (accumulator, program counter) and microcode for instruction decoding. The 8008 (1972) followed as an 8-bit evolution, powering early terminals.  

The 8080 (1974) galvanized the PC revolution: 6 MHz, 4,500 transistors, full 64 KB addressing via segmented memory model. MITS Altair 8800 (1975), a $397 S-100 bus kit advertised in Popular Electronics, sold 10,000 units despite no keyboard or display—users toggled switches for binary programs. Bill Gates and Paul Allen's Microsoft BASIC interpreter, loaded via cassette, made it programmable; the Homebrew Computer Club in Silicon Valley fostered hackers like Steve Wozniak. Apple I (1976), Wozniak's board with 4 KB RAM and video output, evolved into Apple II (1977)—featuring color graphics, floppy drives, and VisiCalc spreadsheet (1979), the "killer app" that justified home computers for business.  

IBM PC (1981), leveraging open architecture with Intel 8088 (4.77 MHz, 29,000 transistors) and Microsoft's MS-DOS, exploded via clones like Compaq. The GUI paradigm shifted with Xerox PARC's Alto (1973)—mouse-driven windows, icons, Ethernet—but Apple Macintosh (1984) popularized it: 68000 CPU, 128 KB RAM, bitmap display at 512x342 resolution. Object-oriented languages like Smalltalk (Alan Kay) influenced C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup, 1985), enabling reusable code via classes and inheritance. The PC era standardized peripherals: hard disk drives (Seagate ST-506, 5 MB), VGA graphics, and MIDI for music sequencing, birthing industries from gaming (Doom, 1993) to desktop publishing (PageMaker). Software commoditized: shrink-wrapped boxes like WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3 dominated until Microsoft Office integrated suites. This democratization propelled computing from elite enclaves to ubiquitous tools, with over 1 billion PCs by 2010.[1]

**Section 5: The Dawn of Networking and the Internet**  

Parallel to hardware's miniaturization, data networking wove the fabric of interconnected computing. ARPANET, launched in 1969 by the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), connected UCLA's Interface Message Processor (IMP) to Stanford Research Institute over a 50 kbps leased line. Packet switching, theorized by Paul Baran (RAND, 1964) and Donald Davies (NPL, 1965), fragmented messages into fixed-size packets with headers encoding source/destination addresses and sequence numbers, routed independently via store-and-forward through decentralized nodes—resilient to single-point failures unlike circuit-switched telephony. Early protocols like NCP (Network Control Protocol) managed 4-node links by 1970, enabling email (Ray Tomlinson's @ symbol, 1971) and file transfers.  

TCP/IP (1974), crafted by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, standardized global communication: IP (Internet Protocol) version 4 assigns 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) for routing via datagrams, while TCP ensures reliability through acknowledgments, retransmissions, sequence numbering, and congestion control (e.g., slow-start algorithm doubling window size exponentially until threshold). ARPANET's "Flag Day" migration to TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, unified disparate networks. NSFNET (1985), a 56 kbps backbone linking supercomputer centers, evolved to T1 (1.5 Mbps) speeds, democratizing access beyond military use. Domain Name System (DNS, 1983) by Paul Mockapetris mapped human-readable names (example.com) to IPs via hierarchical servers, obviating numeric memorization.  

Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web (1989) at CERN layered HTTP atop TCP/IP: stateless request-response where clients fetch HTML documents via GET/POST, parsed by browsers into hyperlinked pages. Mosaic (1993, NCSA) introduced inline images and forms; Netscape (1994) added JavaScript for dynamicity and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for encryption. IPv6 (1998) addressed exhaustion with 128-bit addresses (3.4×10^38 possibilities). BGP (Border Gateway Protocol, 1989) routes inter-autonomous systems via path-vector announcements, enabling peering at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) like MAE-East. By 2000, 400 million users fueled e-commerce (Amazon, 1995) and search (Google, 1998's PageRank algorithm prioritizing inbound links). Fiber optics—core-cladding glass transmitting at 2×10^8 m/s via total internal reflection—now carry 100+ Tbps per strand using dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM), underpinning cloud-scale bandwidth.[1]

**Section 6: Software Engineering Principles and Methodologies**  

Software's complexity exploded, demanding disciplined engineering. Pre-1968 "code-and-fix" yielded unmaintainable spaghetti code with GOTO-laden flows obscuring logic. The NATO Software Engineering Conference (1968) coined the term, advocating abstraction and modularity. Structured programming (Edsger Dijkstra, 1968) banned GOTO, favoring sequential blocks, conditionals (if-then-else), and loops (while-do), provably eliminating certain bugs via structured theorems. Top-down design (Harlan Mills) decomposed systems hierarchically: high-level specs refined into functions with preconditions/postconditions.  

Waterfall Model (Winston Royce, 1970)—though iterative in practice—formalized sequential phases: Requirements elicit user needs (e.g., use cases); System Design architects modules (data flow diagrams, entity-relationship models); Detailed Design specifies algorithms (pseudocode, UML class diagrams); Implementation codes in C/COBOL; Verification tests unit/integration/system (black-box equivalence partitioning, white-box path coverage); Maintenance patches post-deployment. Its documentation-heavy linearity suited contracts like defense projects but faltered on volatile requirements, earning "big design up front" critique.  

Agile Manifesto (2001, 17 authors) pivoted to "individuals and interactions over processes and tools; working software over comprehensive documentation; customer collaboration over contract negotiation; responding to change over following a plan." Scrum (Jeff Sutherland, Ken Schwaber, 1995) structures 2-4 week sprints: Product Owner prioritizes backlog (user stories as "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"); Scrum Master removes impediments; Development Team delivers potentially shippable increments via daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. Kanban visualizes workflow on boards (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done), limiting work-in-progress (WIP) to enforce flow via Little's Law (cycle time = WIP / throughput). Extreme Programming (XP, Kent Beck) stresses test-driven development (TDD: red-green-refactor), pair programming, and continuous integration.  

DevOps (2010s) fused development and operations via culture/tools: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible) provisions idempotently; CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) automate build-test-deploy, achieving 200+ deployments/day at Netflix via canary releases (gradual rollouts with feature flags). Observability triad—logs (ELK stack), metrics (Prometheus), traces (Jaeger)—enables debugging microservices. Twelve-Factor App methodology (Heroku, 2011) prescribes stateless processes, config in environment variables, and backing services (e.g., Postgres as attachment). These paradigms, iterated via feedback loops, sustain software's exponential growth amid Moore's Law.[1]


**Section 7: Modern Hardware and Cloud Computing**  

Cloud computing, operationalized by Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 launch in 2006, virtualizes infrastructure on-demand. AWS S3 (2006) object storage scales to exabytes with 99.999999999% durability via erasure coding (data striped across 10 shards, any 4 suffice for reconstruction). Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provisions instances like t3.micro (2 vCPUs, 1 GB RAM) to p5.48xlarge (192 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, 8 TB RAM) in seconds, billed per millisecond. Google Cloud Platform (GCP, 2008) and Azure (2010) followed, forming the "Big Three" hyperscalers controlling 65% market share by 2025.  

Service models stratify offerings: IaaS (EC2, GCP Compute Engine) exposes VMs with root access; PaaS (Heroku, Google App Engine) abstracts OS/runtime, auto-scaling via Kubernetes (container orchestration with declarative YAML manifests); SaaS (Salesforce, Office 365) delivers turnkey apps. Multi-cloud strategies mitigate lock-in via abstractions like Terraform HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) for idempotent provisioning: `resource "aws_instance" "web" { ami = "ami-12345678" instance_type = "t3.micro" }`. Serverless (AWS Lambda, 2014) executes functions on event triggers (S3 uploads, API Gateway HTTP), charging per 100ms invocation—ideal for bursty workloads like image resizing.  

Hardware accelerates via GPUs: NVIDIA's CUDA (2006) parallelized thousands of cores for matrix multiplications via SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Threads) execution. Tensor Cores (Volta, 2017) fused multiply-accumulate (FMA) at FP16 precision, slashing training times; H100 (2022) delivers 4 PFLOPS FP8 via Transformer Engine for LLMs. TPUs (Google, 2016) ASIC-optimized matrix multiply units (MXUs) achieve 275 TFLOPS BF16/s on v4 pods with 4096 chips interconnected via ICI (Inter-Chip Interconnect) at 1.2 TB/s. Hyperscale data centers—Google's 2.5M servers across 24 regions—interconnect via Clos fabrics (non-blocking, multi-stage Ethernet switches at 400 Gbps ports).[1]

**Section 8: The AI Revolution and GPU Dominance**  

Artificial Intelligence, dormant post-1970s "AI Winter," reignited with deep learning. AlexNet (2012, Krizhevsky) crushed ImageNet via 8-layer CNNs trained on 2 GPUs, leveraging ReLU activation (f(x)=max(0,x)) and dropout regularization to halve error rates. Transformers (Vaswani, 2017) supplanted RNNs with self-attention: \( \text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V \), scaling to billion-parameter models via parallelism—data (batch split), tensor (matrix rows), pipeline (sequential layers).  

LLMs like GPT-3 (175B params, 2020) and Llama 3.1 (405B, 2024) demand GPU clusters: Meta's 24K H100s train via FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) shardings weights/gradients across nodes, minimizing NVLink (900 GB/s GPU-GPU) bottlenecks. Inference optimizes via quantization (INT8/4 via GPTQ), distillation (teacher-student knowledge transfer), and MoE (Mixture of Experts, Switch Transformers routing tokens to 1/8 experts). MLOps pipelines (Kubeflow, MLflow) automate from data ingestion (Apache Kafka streams) to serving (vLLM engine batching requests at 1000+ tokens/s). Edge AI deploys quantized models on Jetson Orin (275 TOPS INT8) for autonomous drones. Ethical concerns—bias amplification, hallucination—spur techniques like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and constitutional AI.[1]

**Section 9: Future Horizons – Quantum, Neuromorphic, and Beyond**  

Quantum computing leverages superposition/cubit entanglement: IBM Quantum Heron (133 qubits, 2023) executes Shor's algorithm factoring 21=3×7 via period-finding quantum Fourier transform. NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices tackle optimization (QAOA for MaxCut graphs) and chemistry (VQE for molecular ground states). Error-corrected logical qubits (Microsoft, 2024) via surface codes threshold ~1% error rates.  

Neuromorphic chips (Intel Loihi 2, 1M neurons) mimic spiking neural networks with event-driven STDP (Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity), slashing power for robotics. Photonics (Lightmatter) replaces electrons with waveguides for 100x faster matrix multiplies at pJ/MAC. Zero-trust security (BeyondCorp) assumes breach, enforcing mTLS and zero-standing privileges. Web3 decentralizes via blockchain: Ethereum's EVM executes smart contracts in 12s blocks post-Merge (PoS, 2022), though scalability lags (sharding to 100K TPS targeted 2026).  

Sustainability pressures data centers: hyperscalers pledge carbon-neutral by 2030 via liquid cooling (H100s at 700W TDP) and renewable PPAs. The sixth computing generation converges AI, quantum, and edge into ambient intelligence—trillions of sensors feeding foundation models for predictive everything, from personalized medicine to climate modeling. This tapestry, woven from Babbage's gears to qubit arrays, propels humanity toward augmented cognition and universal simulation.[1]

Speakers can be built into the computer or can be attached separately. oPlotter A plotter interprets commands from the computer to make line drawings on a paper using multicolored automated pens. Plotters are used for drawing bar charts, graphs, maps, etc. on rolls of papers. Primary and Secondary Memories oMain Memory The memory unit, known as the main memory, directly interacts with the CPU. It is mainly utilized to store programs and data at the time of operating the computer. It is a comparatively fast and large memory. The main memory can be classified into two categories, which are explained in the following sections: oRandom Access Memory (RAM) The memory system in the computer that is easily read from and written to by the processor is the RAM. In the RAM, any address may be accessed at any time, i.e., any memory location can be accessed in a random manner without going through any other memory location. The access search time for all the memory locations is the same. 16
Thus, RAM is the main memory of a computer system. Its main objective is to safely store applications and information that are currently being used by the processor. The operating system directs the use of the RAM by taking different decisions, such as when data should be stored in the RAM, at what memory locations the data should be stored, and so on. The RAM is a very fast memory, both for reading and writing information. The information written in it is retained as long as the power supply is on. All information stored in the RAM is lost when the power supply is switched off. The two main classes of RAM are Static RAM (SRAM) and Dynamic RAM (DRAM). Static RAM (SRAM) A static RAM is made from an array of flip-flops, where each flip-flop maintains a single bit of data within a single memory address or location. Dynamic RAM (DRAM) A dynamic RAM keeps its data only if it is accessed by special logic-called refresh circuit-on a continuous basis. This circuitry reads the data of each memory cell very fast, irrespective of whether the memory cell is being used at that time by the computer or not. The memory cells are constructed in such a way that the reading action itself refreshes the contents of the memory. If not done on a regular basis, the DRAM will lose its contents, even if it has uninterrupted power supply. Because of this refreshing action, the memory is called dynamic oRead Only Memory (ROM) The Read Only Memory, which is a secure memory, is not affected by any interruption in the power supply. It is a non-volatile memory, i.e.,information stored in it is not lost even if the power supply goes off. It is used for permanent storage of information and possesses random access properties. The essential purpose of the ROM is to store the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) of the computer. The BIOS commands the processors to access its resources on receiving power supply to the system. The other use of ROM is the code for embedded systems. The different types of ROMs are now discussed. Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM) Data is written into a ROM at the time of manufacture. However, a user can program the contents with a special PROM programmer. PROM provides flexible and economical storage for fixed programs and data. Erasable Programmable Read only Memory (EPROM) This lets the programmer erase the contents of the ROM and reprogram it. The contents of EPROM cells can be erased with ultraviolet light using an EPROM programmer. This type of ROM provides more flexibility than a ROM during the development of digital systems. Since these are able to retain the stored information for a longer duration, any change can be easily made. Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) In this type of ROM, the contents of the cell can be erased electrically by applying a high voltage. The EEPROM need not be removed physically for reprogramming oMemory Address Map The memory address map is a pictorial representation of the assigned address space for each chip in a system. The interconnection between the memory and processor is established from information on the size of memory required and the type of RAM and ROM chips available. RAM and ROM chips are available in a variety of sizes. If a memory needed for computer is larger than the capacity of one chip, it is necessary to combine a number of chips to get the required memory size. If the required size of the memory is M × N and if the chip capacity is m × n, then the number of chips required. 17
oAuxiliary Memory Storage devices which help in backup storage are called auxiliary memory. RAM is a volatile memory and, thus, a permanent storage medium is required in a computer system. Auxiliary memory devices are used in a computer system for permanent storage of information and hence these are the devices that provide backup storage. They are used for storing system programs, large data files and other backup information. The auxiliary memory has a large storage capacity and is relatively inexpensive, but has low access speed as compared to the main memory. The most common auxiliary memory devices used in computer systems are magnetic disks and tapes. Now, optical disks are also used as auxiliary memory. oMagnetic Disk Magnetic disks are circular metal plates coated with a magnetized material on both sides. Several disks are stacked on a spindle one below the other with read/ write heads to make a disk pack. The disk drive consists of a motor and all the disks rotate together at very high speed. Information is stored on the surface of a disk along a concentric set of rings called tracks. These tracks are divided into sections called sectors. A cylinder is a pair of corresponding tracks in every surface of a disk pack. Disk drives are connected to a disk controller. oFloppy Disk A floppy disk, also known as a diskette, is a very convenient bulk storage device and can be taken out of the computer. It is of 5.25" or 3.5" size, the latter size being more common. It is contained in a rigid plastic case. The read/write heads of the disk drive can write or read information from both sides of the disk. The storage of data is in magnetic form, similar to that of the hard disk. The 3.5" floppy disk has a capacity of storage up to 1.44 Mbytes. It has a hole in the centre for mounting it on the drive. Data on the floppy disk is organized during the formatting process. The disk is also organized into sectors and tracks. The 3.5" high density disk has 80 concentric circles called tracks and each track is divided into 18 sectors. Tracks and circles exist on both sides of the disk. Each sector can hold 512 bytes of data plus other information like address, etc. It is a cheap read/write bulk storage device. oMagnetic Tape A magnetic disk is used by almost all computer systems as a permanent storage device. It is still the accepted low-cost magnetic storage medium, and is primarily used for backup storage purposes. The digital audio tape (DAT) is the normal backup magnetic tape tool used these days. A standard cartridge-size cassette tape offers about 1.2 GB of storage. These magnetic tape memories are similar to that of audio tape recorders. oOptical Disk This (optical disk) storage technology has the benefit of high-volume economical storage coupled with slower times than magnetic disk storage. oCompact Disk-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) The CD-ROM optical drives are employed for storage of data that is circulated for read-only use. A single CD-ROM has the capacity to hold around 800 MB of data. This media can be used when software and huge reports are to be circulated to a large number of users. As compared to floppy disks or tapes, CD-ROM is more dependable for circulation. Nowadays, almost all software and documentations are circulated only on CD-ROM. In a CD-Rom, data is stored uniformly across the disk in parts made of equal size. So, as you go towards the outer surface of the disk, the data stored on a track increases. Thus, CD-ROMs 18
are rotated at changing speeds for reading. Information in a CD-ROM is written by creating pits on the disk surface by shining a laser beam. As the disk rotates, the laser beam traces out a continuous spiral. When 1 is to be written on the disk, a circular pit of around 0.8-micrometer diameter is created by the sharply focussed beam and no pit is created if a zero is to be written. The prerecorded information on a CD-ROM is read with the help of a CD-ROM reader, which uses a laser beam for reading. For this, the CD- ROM disk is inserted into a slot of CD drive. Then, a motor rotates the disk. A laser head moves in and out of the specified position. As the disk rotates, the head senses pits and converted to 1s and 0s by the electronic interface and sent to the computer. Erasable Optical Disk A recent development in optical disk technology is the erasable optical disk. The erasable optical disk can be a substitute for the standard magnetic disk, subject to the condition that the speed of access is not essential and the quantity of data stored is large. The optical disk is used for multimedia, image and high-volume, low-activity backup storage. Data in these disks can be changed repeatedly as in a magnetic disk. The erasable optical disk is portable, highly reliable and has a longer life. It uses a format that makes semi-random access feasible. Secondary Storage MediaCharacteristics Flash MemoryThis type of memory belongs to low power, non-volatile, re-writable. It can carry programs and data into the USB. It transfers digital photos, large documents and back ups of important data. Its size is about 128 MB. DiskIt is portable and swappable. It holds large capacity. It can be recovered fast. Hard disk driveA hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk,[b]  is an electro- mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.[2]  Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data when powered off.[3][4][5]  Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box. Optical MediaIts memory capacity is larger than flash memory but smaller than hard disk. It is re- writable, rugged and portable. It has good back up medium than other storage media. Its typical size is 700 MB and DVD size is about 2.7 GB. TapesIt has larger capacity than all other types of media. It has some exception especially about hard disks. It is relatively cheap to manufacture. It has also good backup medium for networks. Its size is about 19

THE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT OF COMPUTERS In computers there are different types of computing technologies and all are different from each other. By using this we are finding output based on the input given by the user. 26
In a computing environment the user can use a particular computing technology and it is responsible for all the types of input and output given by the computer. The different numbers of computing technologies that are used in OS are as follows − Traditional computing In traditional computing the user can use a traditional method like static memory allocation and it is mainly useful in single user operating systems. In this technique there will be a particular operating system that is going to perform all tasks to that particular computer system. It is like one task is performed by the CPU at a given time and the CPU utilizes the memory that is used only for one task. Now-a-days the traditional computing uses the CPU scheduling method and it is used in desktop, server and other different computers so that the user can manage and give a slice of computer memory to other processes. Mobile computing It refers to the smart phones and tablets and these types of devices having different features. According to mobile computing they can be recognized with the help of storage size, memory size and the service available by the company. When a process is working on a mobile system and it uses some memory space with the help of RAMthenthecalculation regarding the memory space and connection is known as mobile computing. Client-server computing In client-server computing there is a technology available by using a client and server that are connected with each other with the help of a network. When some process or program transfers from client to server or server to client then the memory and I/O calculations is called client- server computing. Basically in the internet the user can use this technology and a network is used to connect the server with the client. So, that the client and server are connected with each other for client- server computing. Peer to peer network 27
In Peer to Peer computing a node first joins the network and a number of nodes are directly connected to the network, so every single node has a direct connection with all the other nodes and this type of computing is called Peer to Peer computing. The Peer to Peer network is a network which is based on specific tasks and it is a centralized service where one single node will be connected to all the other nodes just like our computer where CPU is connected to all resources to perform operation. The figure given below depicts peer to peer network computing − Cloud computing Cloud computing is a type of computing which delivers computing storage and services across the network. All the data is stored in cloud computing because it can be used by different servers to store their data and use whenever they want. In cloud computing different types of servers are used and storage manager is used to manage the computing and there will be cloud management service through which different companies are directly connected with it and store their data. Embedded or real time computing 28
In real time embedded system computing the real time OS is used and in this computing technique he OS that is used is real time OS. When the real time system has defined the time that is fixed and processing must be done within that defined time. In real time embedded computing, it is to control the scientific experiment, medical image system, industrial control system, automobile engine fuel system and their processing time calculation can be done with the help of real time OS. Fog Computing Cisco invented the phrase "Fog Computing," which refers to extending cloud computing to an enterprise's network's edge. As a result, it's also known as Fogging or Edge Computing. It makes computation, storage, and networking services more accessible between end devices and computing data centers. Fog computing is the computing, storage, and communication architecture that employs EDGE devices to perform a significant portion of computation, storage, and communication locally before routing it over the Internet backbone. Fog computing is a type of distributed computing that connects a cloud to a number of "peripheral" devices. (The term "fog" refers to the edge or perimeter of a cloud.) Rather than sending all of this data to cloud-based servers to be processed, many of these devices will create large amounts of raw data (for example, via sensors). The goal of fog computing is to conduct as much processing as possible using computing units that are co-located with data-generating devices so that processed data rather than raw data is sent and bandwidth needs are decreased. Another advantage of processing locally rather than remotely is that the processed data is more needed by the same devices that created the data, and the latency between input and response is minimized. 29
Time Sharing Computing Environment The time sharing computing environment allows multiple users to share the system simultaneously. Each user is provided a time slice and the processor switches rapidly among the users according to it. Because of this, each user believes that they are the only ones using the system. Distributed Computing Environment A distributed computing environment contains multiple nodes that are physically separate but linked together using the network. All the nodes in this system communicate with each other and handle processes in tandem. Each of these nodes contains a small part of the distributed operating system software. Cluster Computing Environment The clustered computing environment is similar to parallel computing environment as they both have multiple CPUs. However a major difference is that clustered systems are created by two or more individual computer systems merged together which then work parallel to each other. 30

COMPUTER LANGUAGES 1. JavaScript What this language is used for: Web development Game development Mobile apps Building web servers According to Stack Overflow's 2020 DeveloperSurvey,JavaScript currently stands as the most commonly-used language in the world (69.7%), followed by HTML/CSS (62.4%), SQL (56.9%), Python (41.6%) and Java (38.4%). It is also the most sought-out programming language by hiring managers in the Americas (PDF, 2.4 MB). JavaScript is used to manage the behavior of web pages. With it, coders can create dynamic web elements such as animated graphics, interactive maps, clickable buttons and more. Programmers who use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in tandem obtain a higher level of website control and can provide a better user experience in terms of navigation and readability. JavaScript is the most common coding language in use today around the world. This is for a good reason: most web browsers utilize it and it's one of the easiest languages to learn. JavaScript requires almost no prior coding knowledge — once you start learning, you can practice and play with it immediately. Moreover, because the language is so ubiquitous, there are countless communities, courses and avenues of professional support available online. This support, in addition to the language's top-notch usability, makes JavaScript number one on our list of the most in-demand programming languages. 2. Python What this language is used for: Back end development Data science App development Pythonisageneral-purpose programming language that empowers developers to use several different programming styles (i.e., functional, object-oriented, reflective, etc.) when creating programs. Several popular digital tools and platforms were developed with Python, including YouTube, Google Search and iRobot machines. It is also, according to HackerRank, the second-most in- demand programming language for hiring managers in the Americas after Python (PDF, 2.4 MB). 32
As one of the more easy-to-learn and -use languages, Python is ideal for beginners and experienced coders alike. The language comes with an extensive library that supports common commands and tasks. Its interactive qualities allow programmers to test code as they go, reducing the amount of time wasted on creating and testing long sections of code. That said, even advanced users would benefit from adding Python to their mental catalog of programming languages; with over 50% of hiring managers (PDF, 2.4MB) seeking candidates who know the language, Python is easily one of the most marketable and in-demand programming languages. 3. HTML What this language is used for: Web documents Website development Website maintenance HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Don't let the complicated- sounding name fool you, though; HTML is one of the most accessible stepping stones into the world of programming. Technically, HTML is a markup language, which means that it is responsible for formatting the appearance of information on a website. Essentially, HTML is used to describe web pages with ordinary text. It doesn't have the same functionality as other programming languages in this list and is limited to creating and structuring text on a site. Sections, headings, links and paragraphs are all part of the HTML domain. As of 2020, HTML shares its #2 spot on Stack Overflow's list of the most commonly used languages in the world with CSS. 4. CSS What this language is used for: Web documents Website development Website design CSS, or cascading style sheets, is usually applied in conjunction with HTML and governs the site's appearance. While HTML organizes site text into chunks, CSS is responsible for determining the size, color and position of all page elements. CSS is convenient, too; the cascading part of the name means that an applied style will cascade down from parent elements to all children elements across the site. This feature means that once users determine aesthetics for the main parent, they won't have to manually repeat their code across a website. Moreover, the delegation of site organization to HTML and aesthetics to CSS means that users don't have to completely rewrite a web page.

The goal of fog computing is to conduct as much processing as possible using computing units that are co-located with data-generating devices so that processed data rather than raw data is sent and bandwidth needs are decreased. Another advantage of processing locally rather than remotely is that the processed data is more needed by the same devices that created the data, and the latency between input and response is minimized. 29
Time Sharing Computing Environment The time sharing computing environment allows multiple users to share the system simultaneously. Each user is provided a time slice and the processor switches rapidly among the users according to it. Because of this, each user believes that they are the only ones using the system. Distributed Computing Environment A distributed computing environment contains multiple nodes that are physically separate but linked together using the network. All the nodes in this system communicate with each other and handle processes in tandem. Each of these nodes contains a small part of the distributed operating system software. Cluster Computing Environment The clustered computing environment is similar to parallel computing environment as they both have multiple CPUs. However a major difference is that clustered systems are created by two or more individual computer systems merged together which then work parallel to each other.
